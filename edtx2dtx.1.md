# NAME
edtx2dtx - Convert .edtx into .dtx


# SYNOPSIS
**edtx2dtx** *filename.edtx* > *filename.dtx*


# DESCRIPTION

This utility wraps code chunks by a (commented and properly indented)
`\begin{macrocode}` and `\end{macrocode}` pair.  A code chunk is any sequence of
lines not introduced by a single (possibly indented) comment character (`%`);
i.e. both non-commented lines and lines introduced by multiple comment
characters count as code, and documentation lines may be indented.

The part of the file which should be processed should be marked by a
`\begin{macrocode}` and `\end{macrocode}` pair.  In other words, everything
preceding `\begin{macrocode}` is considered a header and not changed, and
everything following `\end{macrocode}` is considered a trailer and not changed.
In fact, any number of `\begin{macrocode}` â€” `\end{macrocode}` pairs is
allowed. (The system allows for the driver to remain as is, and also makes it
easy to paste a `.dtx` file into an `.edtx`, as using this utility on a `.dtx`
does not change the file.)

The utility furthermore replaces the first occurrence of `<filename>.edtx` in
the header, followed by an optional parenthesized note, with `<filename>.dtx`,
plus the note on how the file was generated.


# OPTIONS

**-c, \--comment**
: The input comment character; the default is `%`.  (Any input comment
  characters in the header and the trailer will be replaced by the output
  comment character, which is always `%`.)

**-b, \--begin-macrocode** *regex*\

**-e, \--end-macrocode** *regex*
: Use these options to change the default *input* `\begin{macrocode}` and
  `\end{macrocode}` markers.  (The *output* markers are always
  `\begin{macrocode}` and `\end{macrocode}`.)  The markers should be given as
  regular expressions matching the entire line.  The input markers are not kept
  in the file, i.e. they are replaced by the output markers.

**-B, \--Begin-macrocode** *regex*\

**-E, \--End-macrocode** *regex*
: As `-b` and `-e`, but the input markers are kept in the output.

**-s, \--strip-empty**
: If this option is given, empty lines are not included in the output.

**-h, \--help**
: Show help and exit.

**-V, \--version**
: Show the version number and exit.


# EXAMPLES

If `input.edtx` is just like a `dtx` file, just without `\begin{macrocode}` and
`\end{macrocode}` around every chunk of code:

	edtx2dtx input.edtx > output.dtx

Memoize uses the invocation below to produce a `.dtx` from documented Python
code of `memoize-extract.py`.  The value of `-c` adapts the `edtx2dtx` to
Python comments.  `-B` marks everything preceding the version number statement
as a header, and keeps the version number statement in the output.  Similarly,
`-E` says that the processing should stop when encountering Emacs' local
variables (which are kept, unchanged, in the output).

	edtx2dtx -s -c '#' -B '^__version__' -E '^# Local Variables:' $< \
